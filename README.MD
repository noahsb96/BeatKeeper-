## BeatKeeper story
I chose to make this game for my love of drums and music and to be able to incorporate that in my love for 90's games. I remember the playing the simon game as a child and having so much fun with it. A majority of this project was CSS and Javascript. I utilized a lot of arrays and creating functions to push multiple buttons on a webpage. These functions create arrays that have you follow along with sequences in the correct order that the computer is creating them. This is a great memory game that anyone can play whether you play drums or not. At the moment, I am trying to make this into a two player game for added fun with friends or family
